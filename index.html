                <h2>Mcquinley Josh G. Maglangit</h2>
                <p>I am a Second Year Student in University of Science and Technology - Cagayan de Oro Campus,  
                    taking Bachelor of Science Information Technology. I am 20 years old and a beginner programmer.  
                    I wish to learn everything there is to learn in my journey as a student under this school, because  
                    I believe USTP has the tools and the professors that will help me become a programmer. In the future,  
                    I dream of  creating my own game and become a successful game developer and also a web developer.  
                    My personal motto in life is "Things are not impossible, it's just hard". Persistence and diligence, 
                    having the correct attitude and hunger towards your goal, I all learned that the hard way, because 
                    as what Furudate-sensei have said, world is fair and at the same time unfair. There will always be 
                    differences, whether it be physically or mentality, upbringing, or what ever form it may be. 
                    it is always there, however don't despair, accept that you are weak and continue to polish 
                    continue to be hungry, always improve yourself and always keep your head down, be humble. 

                    
                    
                    <br><br><br> That is all for me, have a nice day!
